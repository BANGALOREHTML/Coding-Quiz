## User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

#### What is it?
This is a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores. The quiz is timed and the user is penalized for incorrect answers. The user can save their initials and score to a high score list.
#### Why did I make this?
I made this to practice using JavaScript and to help people practice for their interviews. I also wanted to practice using local storage.

#### How does it work?
The user is presented with a start button. When the user clicks the start button, the timer starts and the user is presented with a question. When the user answers a question, they are presented with another question. When the user answers a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock. When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over. When the game is over, the user can save their initials and score to a list of high scores.
